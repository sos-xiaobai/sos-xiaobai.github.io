## i System Design    
  - Designed a <mark> 3-DOF wheeled-leg </mark> robot chassis, integrating wheeled locomotion with legged movement to enhance mobility and adaptability across diverse terrains. 
    
## ii Control Algorithm  
  - Implemented a high-stability control algorithm leveraging a <mark>Kalman</mark> fusion observer for real-time state estimation and sensor data integration.   
  - Adopted a hybrid control approach combining Linear Quadratic Regulator <mark>(LQR)</mark> for optimal trajectory control and Proportional-Integral-Derivative <mark>(PID)</mark> controllers for precise motion adjustments. 

## iii	Embedded System Development  
  - Developed an embedded system to execute the control algorithm, enabling seamless coordination between the robotâ€™s wheels and legs.   

## iv	Experimental Validation
  - Conducted tests to validate the stability, precision, and adaptability of the control system under various operational scenarios, ensuring optimal performance across complex environments.
